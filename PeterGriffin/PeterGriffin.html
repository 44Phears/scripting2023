<h2>Who is Peter Griffin?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Peter Griffin is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the American animated sitcom Family Guy.
            He and his family live in Quahog, Rhode Island. Peter works at Quahog's shipping department of the Pawtucket
            Brewery.</p>

<h2>Personality And Habits</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Peter's personality traits change from day to day. He is most of the time an inconsiderate, obnoxious husband
            with a childish sense of humor. But he has also shown that he is a loving, caring man who truly loves his
            friends and family. Peter's hobbies consist of watching TV and movies, listening to music and playing video
            games. But his all time favorite pastime is definitely drinking Pawtucket Patriot Ale at The Drunken Clam
            with his best friends.</p>

    <h2>Knowledge And Skills</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Peter Griffin has undeniably proven to be a complete idiot. Every episode features him making stupid,
            unintelligent comments followed by him doing something ridiculously stupid. He never learns from his
            mistakes and will always go right back to doing them again. Peter's IQ is 70, which means that he is
            mentally disabled and is not very knowledgeable about well known things. His best and only real skill is
            drinking beer.
